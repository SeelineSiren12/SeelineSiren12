Hi, I’m Tyra Austin — a cybersecurity analyst with a mission to protect systems, empower people, and constantly learn.

🔐 I’m pursuing my Master’s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University, and I bring hands-on experience in cloud security, ethical hacking, and compliance. With a military background and industry exposure through roles at Intuit and CRIF, I approach every challenge with discipline and curiosity.

🧪 In my home lab, I explore real-world vulnerabilities using Kali Linux, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, and Burp Suite — because I believe the best defense starts with knowing how attackers think.

📚 My work is shaped by standards like NIST 800-53, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, and I’m currently preparing for the Pentest+ exam while building AWS infrastructure aligned with FedRAMP.

Let’s build a more secure future — together.
